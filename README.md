# globlnews
A joint effort of @jonanias, @k-sokolov, @lukeeffenberger for a course project at Uni Osnabrueck\
A first version of a platform for users to read summaries of news articles from other countries and submit their own ones.\
The goal is to provide a 360-degree overview of all the biased opinions out there in the media worldwide about a topic or event.\


Stuff that needs to be installed:

pip install django-braces six\
pip install django-crispy-forms\
pip install django-haystack\
pip install whoosh\
pip install django-countries
